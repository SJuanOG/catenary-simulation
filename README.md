# Catenary Simulation

This is the final project of the course "MÃ©todos computacionales"

This program uses a result of the theory of the calculus of variations that models the functional form of a rope without flexural rigidity, suspended from its two ends at the same height and subjected to a uniform gravitational field, in order to achieve a proper simulation we use a series of mathematical method.

### Methods used

- Steffensen's method for finding roots.
- Simpson's integration method.
- Method of Gaussian integration.
- Euler's method for solving differential equations.
- Interpolation by cubic splines, using the function CubicSpline from the Scipy library.

----------------------

Finally, the numeric result is compared to the analytic one and an animation of the behavior for different distance between tips is shown.

In order to run it you can open it with Google Colaboratory from GitHub or dowload and run it in your local machine usin Jupyter notebook.
